        $this->info('🎯 NEXT STEPS:');
        $this->info('   1. Verify with the user which organizer account reported the issue');
        $this->info('   2. Test with their specific credentials');
        $this->info('   3. Show them the information banner explaining the behavior');
        $this->info('   4. If they need to see all events, direct them to admin access');
